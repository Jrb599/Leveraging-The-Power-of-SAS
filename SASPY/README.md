# SASPY Demo
This folder contains a Jupyter notebook which demonstrats how to leverage SASPY.  More information about SASPY can be found here: https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy

The data for this example was taken from Robert Cohen's paper: <a href='http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings13/401-2013.pdf'>High-Performance Statistical Modeling</a>.  I have converted it to a CSV file for the SASPY example.
