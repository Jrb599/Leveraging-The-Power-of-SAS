## Overview

The code in the hashobjects folder is meant to show SAS users an efficient way to join two datasets together outside of the data step match-merge and SQL join.  
   
Data step hash objects offer two distinct advantages:    
   1) They eliminate the need for preprocessing the data with indexes and sorts.     
   2) They have the <i>potential</i> to greatly reduce processing time.  

The examples in the hashobjects folder are designed to demonstrate different way to implenet hash tables based on your desired outcome.  For each hash object example, I have provided a corresponding SQL statement that will allow you to compare the results.
