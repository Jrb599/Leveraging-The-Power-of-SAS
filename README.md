# Leveraging-The-Power-of-SAS
This repository includes example on how to use:
<ul>
  <li>PROC DS2</li>
  <li>hash tables</li>
  <li>HPA procs</li>
  <li>SASPY</li>
  <li>parallelize independent code with rsubmits (coming soon)</li>
</ul>

This code accomponies a presentation that I do as well.  That is why it is pulled out from other SAS coding folders.

I will add more as I come up with.
